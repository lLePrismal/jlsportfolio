    <h2>Playing Guitar</h2>
    <p>Why I love playing guitar?</p> 
    <p>In the chaos of a weary day, it becomes my calm.</p>  
    <p>Each strum is a whisper of comfort, each note a balm to my restless mind.</p>
    <p>The strings don’t just play music—they untangle my thoughts,
reset my spirit, and turn exhaustion into harmony.</p>
    <p>With every chord, the weight of the day fades,
and what remains is freedom, fire, and soul.</p>
</div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Painting</h2>
    <p>Painting has always been my childhood refuge. 
      <a href="https://jspaintings.wixsite.com/leprisma">(<i>check my latest paintings here</i>)</a> 
    </p>  
    <p>While others found comfort in play, mine was found in colors.</p>
    <p>Every scolding, every tear, every small wound of growing up—
I carried them to the shore, where sand and silence listened.</p>
    <p>There, with my hands and scraps of color, I painted my pain away.</p>
    <p>Brushstrokes became my solace, sketches my escape,
and art my secret language of healing.</p>
    <p>Today, that same comfort lives on in my canvases—
each piece a memory, a confession, a fragment of who I am.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Fishing</h2>
    <p>These days, my soul aches for the sea.</p>
    <p>For the scent of salt carried by the wind,
for the invisible touch of negative ions that reset my weary body clock.</p>
    <p>I crave the waves that whisper of forgotten childhood mornings,
when time was slower, gentler, and the ocean held all the answers.</p>
    <p>And so, I turn to fishing—
not merely to catch, but to remember.</p>
    <p>Each cast of the line is a reaching back,
each ripple on the water a conversation with the past.</p>
    <p>In the stillness between tides, I find what I’ve been longing for:
peace, memory, and the rhythm of life restored.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="conclusion">
    <p>And so, these three loves—my guitar, my brush, and the sea—
bring color, fragrance, and comfort back into a life sometimes dulled by the weight of days.</p>
    <p>Perhaps next time, you could join me by the shore—
to breathe the ocean air, to laugh, to dream,
and let the horizon wash our worries away.</p>

    <p>Ah, and how could I forget—the laughter shared with friends, a bucket of cold beer at our side, and the kind of company that makes every moment taste a little sweeter.</p>
